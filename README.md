Dynamic Temporal Residual Network for Sequence Modeling: A PyTorch Implementation
=================================================================================
This is a PyTorch implementation of the models proposed in "Dynamic Temporal Residual Network for Sequence Modeling" (Ruijie Yan, Liangrui Peng, Shanyu Xiao, Michael T. Johnson and Shengjin Wang).

A novel LSTM-based sequence modeling architecture is proposed. This project supports training and evaluation on three public handwriting recognition datasets (IFN/ENIT, IAM, and Rimes) and one public speech recognition dataset (TIMIT).

The implementations include static temporal residual network (STRN) and dynamic temporal residual network (DTRN) with two types of secondary network: using LSTM and using self-attention.

***The source code is under sorted out and will be uploaded soon.***
